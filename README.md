## 🚀 How It Works

This **Music Player** uses **JavaScript** to control the audio functionality. The HTML provides the structure, while CSS is used to design the player, making it visually engaging. The player fetches and controls audio files, allowing users to interact with the media.

### Files in this project:
- **index.html**: The structure of the player, including buttons for play, pause, next, and previous actions.
- **style.css**: The styling for the music player, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
- **script.js**: Contains all the logic for controlling the music, such as play/pause functionality, updating the progress bar, and handling volume control.





## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LogeshR2005/MusicPlayer.git

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the music player.
